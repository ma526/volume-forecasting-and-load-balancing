Volume Forecasting and Load Balancing for Last-Mile Delivery
Project Overview
Client: E-commerce Logistics Aggregator
Goal: Improve last-mile delivery efficiency and reduce SLA violations through predictive modeling and intelligent partner allocation.

1. Problem Statement
The client was facing:
•	Imbalance in parcel allocation across last-mile delivery partners.
•	Some partners were overloaded, causing late deliveries and SLA violations.
•	Underutilized partners resulted in inefficient resource use.
•	Rising customer dissatisfaction during peak demand periods.

2. Data Collection
Key Data Sources:
•	Historical Package Volume: Daily parcel counts by sku and zip_code.
•	Partner Profiles: Contains partner_id, daily_capacity, on_time_percent, cost_per_package, and assigned tier (Tier 1–3).
•	Calendar Features: Holidays, sales events, promotions.
•	Optional Enhancements: Weather and traffic data.

3. Forecasting Model (01_forecasting_model.ipynb)
Objective
Predict daily parcel volume for each SKU and zip code using a supervised learning approach.
Methodology
•	Model Used: XGBoost Regressor (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
•	Why XGBoost?
o	Handles large datasets efficiently
o	Captures non-linear relationships well
o	Offers regularization and built-in feature importance
•	Features:
o	Date-based features: day of week, month, holiday flag
o	Lag features: previous 7/14/30-day moving averages
o	Rolling windows for SKU-zip patterns
•	Train/Test Strategy:
o	Time-based train-test split
o	Hyperparameter tuning using grid/random search (e.g., max_depth, learning_rate, n_estimators)
Output
•	forecast_output_for_powerbi.csv
o	Columns: date, sku, zip_code, volume
Use in Dashboard
This forecast enables stakeholders to view future demand at a granular level for planning and performance review.

4. Partner Clustering (02_clustering_partners.ipynb)
Objective
Group partners based on performance and capability into tiers for prioritization.
Methodology
•	Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering
o	Why? Easy to implement, efficient for numeric features
o	Distance Metric: Euclidean
o	Initialization: KMeans++
o	Preprocessing: Standardization (important for fair distance calculations)
•	Features Used:
o	daily_capacity
o	on_time_percent
o	cost_per_package
•	Elbow Method or Silhouette Score used to determine optimal number of clusters
Output
•	clustered_partners_for_allocation.csv
o	Includes tier assignment per partner

5. Partner Allocation Logic (03_allocation_strategy.ipynb)
Objective
Assign forecasted volume to partners based on availability, cost, and SLA performance.
Allocation Phases
Phase 1: Initial Attempt (Linear Programming)
•	Tool: scipy.optimize.linprog
•	Objective: Minimize total score (based on cost and on-time %)
•	Constraints:
o	Demand must be met
o	Allocation should not exceed capacity
•	Issue: LP may fail if demand > combined capacity; allocation often favors a few top partners.
Phase 2: Custom Greedy Allocation
•	Partners sorted by performance score.
•	Each day's total volume split from top-tier downward.
•	Drawback: Still favors high-performing partners, reducing load balance.
Phase 3: Optimized Greedy with Load Spread
•	Designed for daily load balance across partners.
•	Key Enhancements:
o	Weighted scoring (e.g., 30% cost, 70% on-time)
o	Tracks cumulative partner allocation to discourage repetitive top-choice allocations
o	Ensures progressive spread if demand exceeds single partner capacity
Final Output
•	optimized_partner_allocation.csv
o	date, partner_id, allocated_volume, tier, cost_per_package, on_time_percent

6. Load Balancing Strategy (Advanced Optimization)
Goal
Distribute load across SKUs and ZIPs fairly without over-relying on top-performing partners.
Key Strategy
•	Greedy Multi-pass Allocation:
o	Consolidate demand by day and region (optional: zip groupings)
o	Rank partners by normalized cost and on-time %
o	Allocate incrementally until demand is met across partners
o	Monitor partner usage across days to avoid overload patterns

7. PowerBI Integration
Files Provided:
•	forecast_output_for_powerbi.csv
•	optimized_partner_allocation.csv
•	Partner profiles with clustering tiers
Suggested Dashboards:
•	Forecast Heatmap by ZIP & SKU
•	Partner Allocation Timeline
•	SLA & Cost Efficiency by Partner Tier
•	Load Balance Metrics

8. Recommendations for Junior Data Scientists
Best Practices
•	Always normalize features when scoring across metrics with different scales (e.g., cost vs %).
•	Validate clustering output—visualize with PCA if needed.
•	During allocation, account for fairness—not just optimal score.
•	Break large problems into daily batches to reduce optimization complexity.
Suggested Enhancements
•	Add weather and traffic data to forecast volatility.
•	Use Gurobi or OR-Tools for advanced load balancing.
•	Consider historical partner saturation in allocation logic.
•	Implement failover planning if primary partners are unavailable.

10. Summary
This project delivered a modular, scalable approach to forecasting demand and dynamically allocating logistics partners. By forecasting volumes, clustering partners by performance, and creating a hybrid optimization strategy, we achieved improved SLA compliance and better resource utilization.
This documentation serves as a base for onboarding junior data scientists and helping them understand the logic and lifecycle of a supply chain ML optimization project.
